LOGISTIC REGRESSION

My project is based on the development of a machine learning using the concepts of Logistics Regression. 

Logistic Regression can be understood as a binary classification algorithm. For example, for this project, it is performed the recognition or not of cat figures in the tested images. For this purpose, an algorithm was used that allowed us to go through the computer directories to separate the cat and dog images and indicate them by labels, being 0 for cats and 1 for dogs, this way our result should be a prediction of the image tested, being 0 or 1. 

Moreover, it is important to note that this project is a Logistic Regression model for study and knowledge of how machine learning works for simple situations, without using mechanisms and frameworks, which would have a more significant efficiency, but which is not the goal in this work. This can be seen, by the uses of various functions of calculations such as Sigmoide, Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation.

Thanks, and enjoy.
